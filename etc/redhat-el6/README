To setup on RedHat 6 or one of its clones:

# Create a service account for the daemon to run as
useradd -r -m inbucket

# Create datastore directory
mkdir /var/opt/inbucket
chown inbucket: /var/opt/inbucket

# Copy logrotate config into place
cp inbucket.logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/logrotate
chown root: /etc/logrotate.d/logrotate

# Copy init script into place and activate
cp inbucket-init.sh /etc/init.d
chown root: /etc/init.d/inbucket
chmod 755 /etc/init.d/inbucket
chkconfig --add inbucket

# Copy the sample config into place
# NOTE: there is a "cap" command in the init script that allows inbucket
#       to listen on privileged ports without running as root.
cp ../unix-sample.conf /etc/opt/inbucket.conf
chown root: /etc/opt/inbucket.conf

(confirm /etc/opt/inbucket.conf is to your liking)

# Start the daemon
service inbucket start

# Confirm it stayed running
service inbucket status

# Check inbucket's startup messages
less /var/log/inbucket.log
